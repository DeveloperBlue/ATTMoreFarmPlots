Adds another set of farm plots next to the original farm behind the tavern.

Works in multiplayer (All clients must have the mod installed to see and use the farm).

Good companion mod for the [More Players](https://thunderstore.io/c/ale-and-tale-tavern/p/DeveloperBlue/MorePlayers/) mod.

## Installation

The only requirement for this mod is [BepInEx](https://thunderstore.io/c/ale-and-tale-tavern/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack/).

### Mod Manager (Recommended)

- Install this mod directly in r2modman or the Thunderstore Launcher by clicking the big blue "Install with Mod Manager" button above.

### Manual Installation

- To manually install this mod, download and unzip the file. Place the folder in your {game}/BepInEx/plugins folder.

## Multiplayer
- This mod works in multiplayer. 

*All clients must have the mod installed to see and use the new farm plots.*

## Uninstalling

Trying to load your world up after uninstalling the mod may crash. This is because the game is trying to load the saved extra plots into slots that don't exist anymore. To fix this, you can open your save file up and delete the extra saved plots.
